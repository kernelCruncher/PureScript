# PureScript
There are several PureScript projects in the repo. The key files are index.html and index.js. To run the application open the index.html file in a browser.

+ The first project "Random" is an extension of an exercise in the _PureScript by Example_ book. Clicking on the canvas causes 100 circles of random sizes, colour and location to appear on the canvas. As the user continues to click the circles begins to layer in a rather psychedelic way.
+ The second project "Fractal" is another extension of an exercise in the _PureScript by Example_ book. Here, a user clicks on a canvas and a fractal gradually emerges.
